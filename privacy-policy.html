<h1>Privacy Policy — ABC Fun</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>ABC Fun ("the App") is a free educational app designed for children. We take your child's privacy very seriously. This policy explains what information we collect — which is essentially nothing.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal information from users. The App runs entirely on-device. No accounts, no sign-ups, no tracking.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
<p>This App is designed for children and fully complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Google Play's Families Policy. We do not collect any personal information from children under 13 (or any age).</p>

<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>The App may display non-personalized, age-appropriate advertisements served through Google AdMob with child-directed treatment enabled. These ads do not use behavioral targeting or personal data. AdMob may collect non-personal device identifiers solely for ad serving and frequency capping, as described in Google's advertising policies.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App uses the device's built-in text-to-speech engine to pronounce letters. No audio data is recorded or transmitted. The only third-party service is Google AdMob for displaying age-appropriate ads.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>No data is stored on external servers. All app functionality runs locally on your device.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>If we update this policy, we will post the revised version here with a new date.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
